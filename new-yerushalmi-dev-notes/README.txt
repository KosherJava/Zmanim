This directory contains scripts and files
to help convert yerushalmi daf yomi tables to usable code

README.txt - this file 
ArtScrollPdf - original attempt to extract data from Artscroll PDF
hebcal.com   - more files from website of same name - not used at this time
DafYomiCoIlWebSite - cut and paste html tables from this site and pasted to spread sheet and saved as csv
		     Work went on from there


Note:  at first I thought that there where just differences in page counts 
however I discoved to other things
1) The Original scedual skips Yom Kippur and TiSha-BaAv - the new one does not
2) The order of the Mesactas in the scedual differs



I opened a spreadsheet and pasted the website csv and Artscroll pdf csv side by side  on same spreadsheet
and confirmed that the mesechtos and pages and dates all lined up so using the website csv as source
