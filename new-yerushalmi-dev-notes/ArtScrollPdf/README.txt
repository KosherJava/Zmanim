Original attempt to get data for 11th cycle from 
Artscroll PDF
Howwever found a cleaner easier to work with data from  www.dafyomi.co.il that is in ../DafYomiCoIlWebSite


Source files:
-------------
yerushalmi-yomi-calendar_download_new.pdf - Used as source data
parsepdf.sh -  bash file to extract csv from pdf
		uses: pdftohtml  sed grep and python 

clean.py   -  python to assist bash file
cleanup.sh - remove generated files

Generted files:
---------------
yerushalmi.csv - somewhat useable result file but not compleatly clean

parse.out  - input for python script
yerushalmi-yomi-calendar_download_new-html.html - generated by pdftohtml
yerushalmi-yomi-calendar_download_news.html - generated by pdftohtml
