This directory contains scripts and files
to help convert yerushalmi daf yomi tables to usable code

README.txt - this file 
ArtScrollPdf - original attempt to extract data from Artscroll PDF
DafYomiCoIlWebSite - cut and paste html tables from this site and pasted to spread sheet and saved as csv
		     Work went on from there


Note:  at first I thought that there where just differences in page counts 
however I discoved to other things
1) The Original scedual skips Yom Kippur and TiSha-BaAv - the new one does not
2) The order of the Mesactas in the scedual differs
